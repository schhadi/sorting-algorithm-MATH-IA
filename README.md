## ⚡ About This Project

In this project, we’ll explore how different sorting algorithms perform on datasets of varying sizes. It’s like a **race**, but for algorithms! 🏁 Our contenders:
- **Merge Sort** 🧩
- **Bubble Sort** 🍭
- **Radix Sort** 🏎️

### 🚀 Why Sorting Algorithms?
Sorting algorithms are essential in computer science and mathematics! 🧑‍💻 From organizing your files to optimizing search engines, sorting is everywhere! For my **IB Math IA**, I'm analyzing the time complexities and real-world performance of these algorithms to see which one comes out on top.

## 🧠 The Math Behind It

This isn’t just about writing code! Here’s a glimpse of the **mathematical concepts** explored:
- **Big O Notation**: The theoretical performance of algorithms. 📈
- **Time Complexity**: How fast (or slow!) an algorithm works on datasets of different sizes. 🕰️
- **Statistical Analysis**: We'll run 10 trials per dataset to calculate average performance, comparing theoretical expectations with real-world results. 🎯
